## Nimbo's Earth Basemaps

Nimbo's Earth Basemaps is an innovative Earth observation service providing cloud-free, homogenous mosaics of the world's entire landmass as captured by satellite imagery. Updated every month.

Along with this unprecedented refresh rate, Nimbo Earth Basemaps provides users with 4 data layers every month :

- Infrared (NIR)
- NDVI (vegetation helath index)
- Radar (SAR, VV/VH combination)

*Maximum image resolution is 10m/px.
Images are served in WMS/WMTS format.*

Nimbo Earth Basemaps meets a variety of requirements for geospatial analysis professionals, including visualizations fit for machine learning algorithm implementation, monitoring tasks and training models based on time series.

Nimbo Earth Basemaps' views consist of monthly syntheses using imagery from Sentinel 1 and 2 satellites from the European Copernicus programme.
